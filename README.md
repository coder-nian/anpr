# ANPR - Automatic Number Plate Recognition system
#### Note - This project is a part of Minor Project Session 2023-24 of PPN College, Kanpur. This is not an open source project. 
----
The ANPR System is designed to autonomously capture, process, and 
interpret license plate information from images or video streams 
acquired through surveillance cameras installed at strategic locations. 
This system's implementation promises to significantly enhance 
decision-making processes, accuracy in law enforcement, and 
efficiency in managing traffic and parking systems.
